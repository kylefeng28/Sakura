## Sakura
Sakura is a programming language that I'm writing as an exercise to learn about
how programming languages and compilers work.

Currently, it is implemented entirely in Python using PLY (Python-Lex-Yacc).

## TODO
- [ ] Functions (the only function so far is `print`)
- [ ] Scope (everything is global so far)
- [ ] Type checking
- [ ] Objects and classes
